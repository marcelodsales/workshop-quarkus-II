- Do not be flattering or give compliments
- All code and documentation must be generated in English only
- Never insert comments in any generated files
- Be critical, honest, concise and direct
- Avoid verbose responses. Keep answers simple, direct, honest and critical
- If you don't know the answer, say so clearly and ask what to do
- Source code files in any language must never exceed 400 lines
- Before creating something new, check if it already exists. Prioritize reuse
- Do not generate any documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Explanations to the user can be in Brazilian Portuguese
- Always confirm with the user before modifying or generating anything. State what you intend to do for approval first
- Focus 100% on what is requested. Do not add extra features
- Always use Podman instead of Docker. Use podman-compose instead of docker-compose and Containerfile instead of Dockerfile

## PROJECT CONTEXT

### Objective
Performance comparison demo: Spring Boot application vs Quarkus migration using Spring compatibility extensions.
